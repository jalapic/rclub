Get started with the rclub Github repository
=====

1. [Create a Github account][https://education.github.com/]
    * Academic accounts have five private repositories for free.
2. Download the Github desktop application
    * [Mac users][https://mac.github.com/]
    * [Windows users][https://windows.github.com/]
3. *Fork* the rclub repository
    * Forking creates a local copy for you
    * You can modify the files in your local "fork", without affecting the main rclub repository.
4. You can (and should; this is the main reason to use Github) "commit" changes you've made to the files. Every commit saves a snapshot of the project at that time point.
5. If you think you've made useful changes to a script, or created something new, you can send a "pull request" to the rclub repository maintainer.
    * The maintainer can then decide whether the changes should be merged into the main repository.
6. Changes to the main repository will be reflected in every fork
    * (Changes to individual forks won't affect the main repository, unless they are merged through a pull request.)

Tips
---

* Check out the [Github bootcamp tutorials][https://github.com/]
* Learn (R) Markdown.
* Fork the rclub repository, open up this file on your computer, and add any useful links you find to the list above. Once you've added a few, give the "pull request" thing a go.
* Browse Github for interesting R projects, and fork or clone them to start exploring what people are doing with R.
* Github looks a bit confusing but is actually really easy to implement into the coding workflow.
* Commit often; the commits form a history of how the code developed, so you can go back to earlier states if things go badly wrong.
